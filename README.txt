this folder called api/ that youre curently in contains all the main workings of the express backend. 

The main communication is done between app.js, the router js files in the ./routers folder, and the views that are rendered from those routers are stored in ./views.

if you dont understand the communication between each part, i labelled comments in //README within the app.js folder and it directs you from there.
